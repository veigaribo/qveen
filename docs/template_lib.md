This file documents the template utilities made available for users of
Qveen.

In this document, a "character" mean a grapheme representable as a
single Unicode code point.

A "word" is defined as a sequence of characters that does not contain a
space.

If you don't know what a character being "title case" means, read it as
"upper case".

# Functions

## Text

### uppercase :: string -> string
### lowercase :: string -> string

Transforms the string to upper and lower case respectively.

```
{{uppercase "in the early days computers were much simpler"}}

=> IN THE EARLY DAYS COMPUTERS WERE MUCH SIMPLER
```

### titlecase :: string -> string

Makes the first character of each word title case. Other characters are
not affected.

Note that this is not smart enough to ignore words such as "the" and
"is".

```
{{titlecase "in the early days computers were much simpler"}}

=> In The Early Days Computers Were Much Simpler
```

### pascalcase :: string -> string

Makes the first character of each word title case and removes every
space. Other characters are not affected.

```
{{pascalcase "in the early days computers were much simpler"}}

=> InTheEarlyDaysComputersWereMuchSimpler
```

### camelcase :: string -> string

Makes the first character of each word, except the first, title case,
and removes every space. Other characters are not affected.

```
{{camelcase "in the early days computers were much simpler"}}

=> inTheEarlyDaysComputersWereMuchSimpler
```

### snakecase :: string -> string

Substitutes every space character for an `_`. Other characters are not
affected.

```
{{snakecase "in the early days computers were much simpler"}}

=> in_the_early_days_computers_were_much_simpler
```

### kebabcase :: string -> string

Substitutes every space character for a `-`. Other characters are not
affected.

```
{{kebabcase "in the early days computers were much simpler"}}

=> in-the-early-days-computers-were-much-simpler
```

### constcase :: string -> string

Transforms every character to upper case and substitutes every space
character for an `_`. Same as `uppercase` then `snakecase`.

```
{{constcase "in the early days computers were much simpler"}}

=> IN_THE_EARLY_DAYS_COMPUTERS_WERE_MUCH_SIMPLER
```

### dotcase :: string -> string

Substitutes every space character for a `.`. Other characters are not
affected.

```
{{dotcase "in the early days computers were much simpler"}}

=> in.the.early.days.computers.were.much.simpler
```

### sentencecase :: string -> string

Makes the first character title case. Other characters are not affected.

```
{{sentencecase "in the early days computers were much simpler"}}

=> In the early days computers were much simpler
```

## Containers

### map :: ...any -> map[string]any

Shall be called with alternating keys and values. Returns a map that
associates every key with its accompanying value.

```
{{range $k, $v := map "key1" "value1" "key2" "value2"}}{{$k}}: {{$v}}{{end}}

=> key1: value1key2: value2
```

### list :: ...any -> []any

Creates a slice with the argument values.

```
{{range list "first" "last"}}{{.}}~{{end}}

=> first~last~
```

## jq

Qveen allows the usage of `jq` queries in templates. Under the hood,
<https://github.com/itchyny/gojq> is being used.

### jq1 :: string -> any -> any

Applies the query in the first argument to the object in the second.
Returns the first result found, or `nil` if there was none.

```
{{- $data := (list (map "n" 1) (map "n" 2) (map "n" 3)) -}}
{{jq1 ".[].n | select(. > 1)" $data}}

=> 2
```

### jqn :: string -> any -> []any

Applies the query in the first argument to the object in the second.
Returns a slice containing every result found.

```
{{- $data := (list (map "n" 1) (map "n" 2) (map "n" 3)) -}}
{{jqn ".[].n" $data}}

=> [1 2 3]
```

## Miscellaneous

### err :: string -> âŠ¥

Fails with the given reason.

```
{{err "This is wrogn."}}

=> Failed to execute template: template: qveen:1:2: executing "qveen" at <err "This is wrogn.">: error calling err: This is wrogn.
```

### tmpl :: string -> any -> string

Invokes the template with the name given in the first argument and the
argument in the second. Is basically the same as `{{template}}`, but,
being a function, allows for arbitrary expressions / pipelines as
arguments.

```
{{- define "n" -}}{{.}}{{- end -}}
{{tmpl "n" 3 }}

=> 1
```

# Templates

### join

Join intersperses template segments, so that every element is separated
by something, but that something does not appear before or after the
ends. The parameter should be a map containing the following keys and
values:

- `tmpl`: A string containing the name of the template that will be
renderer on each item. That template will receive its corresponding item
as its argument;
- `els`: The list of values from which to render;
- `sep`: The value used to separate each item;
- `pre`: If and only if there are any items in `els`, this will be
  output before anything else. Surprisingly useful.

```
{{- $items := (list "orange" "pear" "apple") -}}
{{- define "item" -}}{{.}}{{- end -}}
{{template "join" (map "tmpl" "item" "els" $items "sep" " - " "pre" "FRUITS\n")}}

=> FRUITS
orange - pear - apple
```

# Trimmers

Qveen utilises a modified template parser that recognizes the following
extra trimmers:

### ~

This trimmer will only trim horizontal space characters, so not
carriage return or line feed.

```
s := `
	{{- "In the early days computers were much simpler."}}
	{{~ "The various components of a system were developed together "}}
	{{- "and, as a result, were quite balanced in their performance."}}
`
```

### #

- If this trimmer is on the left, it will seek whitespace until it
finds something that is not whitespace. Then, if it was on a different
line from where it started, it will leave that line's line break
behind and consume the rest. If there was trailing whitespace in that
line, it will be kept too.

- If this trimmer is on the right, it will seek whitespace until it
finds something that is not whitespace. Then, if it was on a different
line from where it started, it will leave that line's whitespace behind
and consume the rest.

Made mainly to be used on control actions, where no output is produced.
Allows for cleanly joining lines without much worry for whitespaces.

```
import (
	{{# if $usesfmt #}}
	"fmt"
	{{# end #}}
	"github.com/veigaribo/qveen/utils"
	{{# if $usesfmt #}}
	"github.com/veigaribo/qveen/prompts"
	{{# end #}}
	"strings"
)
```
